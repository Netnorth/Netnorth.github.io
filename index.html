<h1>Hello, Sweetheart! 𐔌՞. .՞𐦯 </h1>
<p>The rains have their oceans and the sun has its moon. Everything needs a reason for falling and i have you.
You did your best, and your best does not have to be perfect. Keep going because your life doesn't end any failure. Feels like home i've never been to, but have known my whole life. I love you in every season, through all the changes in your soul. I love you every month, my love for you reaches times that don't exist.</p>
